# Kamika

> _Track, value, and celebrate your Pokémon card collection — all in one app._  
> _For collectors who value the joy of collecting as much as the cards themselves._

**Kamika** is named from the Japanese words **"kami" (神 / 紙)** meaning _god_ or _paper_, and **"ka" (か)** meaning _essence_ or _change_. Together, _Kamika_ symbolises the **divine joy of collecting cards** — where every piece of glossy paper holds stories, nostalgia, and wonder.

Built exclusively for **Pokémon TCG collectors**, Kamika is designed to help you enjoy your collection, your way. Whether you're tracking a few favourites, working toward a full Dex, or just love admiring your cards, Kamika makes it effortless to organise, value, and explore what you own — without pushing you to sell or trade unless _you_ want to.

## ✨ Why Kamika?

Most collector apps are built for selling. **Kamika is built for collecting.**

From set completion tools to beautiful theming, Kamika is designed to be simple, lovable, and complete. And with our unique **Collector Mode**, you can hide all features related to trading or selling — keeping the focus entirely on the joy of owning and building your Pokémon collection.
